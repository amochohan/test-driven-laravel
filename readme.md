# Getting started with test driven Laravel 

This project accompanies the presentation I gave at PHP London. You can find each feature which was built as a separate branch, and each commit should be easy enough to follow along to understand the process of using tests to guide the development of your api.

The slides which were used in the presentation are available via https://speakerdeck.com/amochohan/getting-started-with-test-driven-laravel
